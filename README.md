# Codeforces Rating-Based Heatmap

## Overview

This project visualizes a Codeforces user's problem-solving activity in a **heatmap format**. Unlike the standard Codeforces heatmap, which only considers the number of problems solved per day, this heatmap is **based on the highest-rated problem solved each day**.

## Key Features

- **üé® Rating-Based Colors**  
  The heatmap color on a given day represents the **maximum rating** of a problem solved that day.

- **üñ±Ô∏è Hover for Details**  
  - Hovering over any day in the heatmap shows a **tooltip** with all problems solved on that day.  
  - The tooltip includes:
    - üìå **Problem Name**  
    - ‚≠ê **Problem Rating**  
    - üîó **Direct Link to the Problem**  

- **üìÖ Multi-Year Support**  
  - Analyze past performance across **multiple years** with ease.

## üé® Color Mapping

The heatmap colors are based on the highest-rated problem solved on a given day. Here‚Äôs the rating-to-color mapping:

| Problem Rating Range | Color |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| 3000+        | ![#AA0000](https://placehold.co/15x15/AA0000/AA0000.png) `Dark Red` |
| 2600-2999    | ![#FF0000](https://placehold.co/15x15/FF0000/FF0000.png) `Bright Red` |
| 2400-2599    | ![#FF6464](https://placehold.co/15x15/FF6464/FF6464.png) `Light Red` |
| 2300-2399    | ![#FFBB55](https://placehold.co/15x15/FFBB55/FFBB55.png) `Orange` |
| 2100-2299    | ![#FFCC88](https://placehold.co/15x15/FFCC88/FFCC88.png) `Light Orange` |
| 1900-2099    | ![#FF55FF](https://placehold.co/15x15/FF55FF/FF55FF.png) `Purple` |
| 1600-1899    | ![#AAAAFF](https://placehold.co/15x15/AAAAFF/AAAAFF.png) `Light Blue` |
| 1400-1599    | ![#77DDBB](https://placehold.co/15x15/77DDBB/77DDBB.png) `Aqua Green` |
| 1200-1399    | ![#77FF77](https://placehold.co/15x15/77FF77/77FF77.png) `Green` |
| 0-1199       | ![#CCCCCC](https://placehold.co/15x15/CCCCCC/CCCCCC.png) `Gray` |

## How It Helps

- Provides an **honest measure** of problem difficulty solved over time.
- Helps track and analyze **problem-solving trends** based on difficulty.
- Allows users to **review past problem-solving history** easily by hovering over days.
- Prevents inflation by solving only easy problems and provides a true measure of problem-solving difficulty.
- Ideal for self-assessment and tracking competitive programming improvement.
